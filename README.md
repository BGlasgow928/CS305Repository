Question 1: Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Response 1: Artemis financial is a financial sector company requesting additional security for their web application. Given that they are a financial sector company, Artemis Financial holds the security at the utmost importance.

Question 2: What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Response 2: I felt that when addressing the company's security concerns, especially in project 2, something I feel that I did well was my selection of a industry standard, secure yet efficient cipher. SHA-256 is revered as one of the best ciphers that one can use and it is commonly used in both the government and financial sectors. It is important to code securely, especially in the afformentioned sectors because if your code is not secure it could potentially be detrimental to the client or users financial or physical wellbeing. For example unauthorized access to someones bank account could mean financial hardship to a user and a terrible mess to clean up for the client company, not to mention, likely a hefty fine. Likewise, if someone gets unauthorized access to top secret information in the goverment sector it could be detrimental to an entire nation.

Question 3: What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Response 3: I feel that the assessment help me to better outline the security needs of the clients software, which in turn helped me in selecting a proper cipher to use for encryption.

Question 4: How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Response 4: I chose to mitigate the issues by keeping libraries updated, supressing false-positives, and provided efficient encryption and decryption using an algorithm cipher. In the future I would look into diving deeper into possible vulnerabilities to make my code as secure as possible

Question 5: How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Response 5: I did that with periodical testing and a dependency check both before and after refactoring the code.

Question 6: What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Response 6: Using the textbook and previous knowledge of java coding practices helped me within my assignments and projects. Keeping security as one of the centerpoints in future assignments is something I will be considering.

Question 7: Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Response 7: I will show them my understanding of the crucial importance of software security and how it not only protects the program, but also the user and client company from the negative implications of unauthorized access.
